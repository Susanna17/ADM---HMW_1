Here is my first Assignment.
I have uploaded a Jupiter File containing the exercises I did on HackerRank. There're also my Pdfs Files with my submissions both on HackerRank and the AWS Modules.

I had a little programming background on Python and I am currently doing a Traineeship as a Web Developer using Java.

I did some task (mainly the "Regex and Parsing challenges" and the "Closures and Decorations") collaborating with some colleagues.

Lastly, I frequently used StackOverflow, Python Documentation, Geeksforgeeks and W3schools
